# Introduction
A simple ecommerce website created using React, styled using Sass and data stored in Firebase. It was a project we had to create to apply our knowledge on react and firebase as database. Website contains 3 pages: products page that displays the list of products available, product details page that contains more information on the product selected from the products page, and cart page which displays the list of items added by the customer. There are different variety of each product and customer has an option of how much quantity they need. The cart page display total price which automatically calculates the total price of each product depending on how many quantity and the total price for the products in their cart.
